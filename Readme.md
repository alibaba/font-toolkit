Toolkit used to load, match, measure and render texts.

**NOTE: This project is a work in progress. Text measuring and positioning is a complex topic. A more mature library is a sensible choice.**

Compile the module:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --out-name index --out-dir wasm-node --dev
node examples/basic.js
```
